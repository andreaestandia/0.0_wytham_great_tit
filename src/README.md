`substitute_loci_plink.py` -  This Python script provides a function called replace_values, which reads a text file (input_file) and looks for specific values to replace based on a substitution list. The substitution list is provided in another file (substitution_file), where each line contains a pair of values: the value to find and the value to substitute it with. It will substitute the old names for loci for the 10K dataset wiht the 600K names in order to find the common SNPs.
